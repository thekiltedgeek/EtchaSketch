# EtchaSketch
Repo for Odin Project Javascript/JQuery lesson

My solution (still a bit of a WIP) to the Odin Project Javascript/JQuery project to build an "Etch-a-Sketch with a bit of funk".  The approach is very simple: an index.html page to hold the basic structure, a css file with static properties of HTML elements and a jquery script file to do the dirty work.
